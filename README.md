# hello-world
hello world of coding. hello neets and shut ins I ve been one of u this far now I decided to learn coding so maybe I could be someone useful for the society and earn my own money finally ....
I love fixing problems and learning but such times comes when u are unable to do or you just can not focus or the environment, anyways we should always stick to the plan and do our bests so even if we can't reach to the target we'll feel a relief, yes a relief you might be clingy or obessive about such things but brain works this way works faster then you recognise or feel the changes.
