# hello-world
hello world of coding. hello neets and shut ins I ve been one of u this far now I decided to learn coding so maybe I could be someone useful for the society and earn my own money finally ....
I love fixing problems and learning but such times comes when u are unable to do or you just can not focus or the environment, anyways we should always stick to the plan and do our own best so even if we can't reach the target we'll feel relief you might not be able to accept the failure but brain works this way, it works faster than you can recognise or feel the changes but its not because of that its because of our feelings in order to beat that you should focus on your dreams and aims, never give up and get back up, recover it doesn't matter how many times you fall on your back as long as you've got the strength to get back up. and for the final know your limits too don't put too much burden on yourself.
